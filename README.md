Etch-a-Sketch

The aim of this project is to use my knowledge of Javascript and jQuery to build a broswer version of a sketchpad / Etch-A-Sketch. 

This project is inspired from The Odin Project.

Conclusion and Final Thoughts

Skills involved:

-Defining "for" loops
-Using "if-else" JavaScript conditions
-Using jQuery to change HTML/CSS content dynamically
-Using jQuery to listen to what the user does and react accordingly
-Applying basic CSS to style the sketchpad


This was a challenging yet fun project to do. I mainly struggled with creating the div cells and tweaking the "Fade to Black" function to change the cell's opacity with mouse hover. I got my first real taste of what debugging feels like!
I can confidently say that I gained some valuable practical knowledge while doing this project.
